## Projects

### 1. Django CRUD Example

The "Simple CRUD in Django" project was a web application developed using the Django framework, designed to demonstrate the fundamental aspects of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations). It served as an educational and practical exercise for learning Django web development. Some of the key features include:

- Database Modeling: Designed a MySQL database schema to store data related to a specific domain, ensuring data integrity and normalization.
- Frontend Development: Developed a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to enable users to interact with the application.
- Backend Development: Implemented the CRUD functionality in Django, handling data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion through Django models and views.
- Data Validation: Implemented form validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and user-friendly error messages.
- Deployment: Deployed the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) to make it accessible to users worldwide.
